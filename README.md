# Christmas

This is the app code associated with the tutorial over at [my blog](http://blog.matthewmascioni.com/2013/11/28/Christmas-Countdown.html) for creating a super-simple iPhone app to count down the days until Christmas.

Fire it up in Xcode, and enjoy :) No additional dependencies are required.
